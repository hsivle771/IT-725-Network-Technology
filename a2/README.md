### Program description ###

Briefly describe how your code works and how to test it. This includes the required platform, compiler, libraries, build instructions, etc.

Program Description:

For this assignment, I decided to use python again because it's a very flexible language that's easy to read.
I used an online IDE which runs on the cloud as oppose to running it on command line like I did for Assignment 1.
The first thing I added was code that asks for user input, then runs that input through tests to see if it's in the right format.

Then I segmented the IP address into a list. This makes it easier for me to edit the individual octets as integers.

Once that was done, I added a lot of conditionals (if, else-if, else) based on the given prefix to see what numbers are changing and what-
numbers are static (the prefix id).

After sorting the positions of the numbers, I convert them to a string, assign them to the output variables, and format the print statement-
so the output is displayed as required by the assignment description.
