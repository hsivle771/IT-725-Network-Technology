### Program description ###
### This program takes a url, which I used "https://youtube.com" and creates a request object that will be used to send a HTTTPS request to that website. With the request object, we can use built-in functions from the requests library to get the first few lines of the content and the elapsed time. ###

### Program instructions ###
### 1) Have python installed in your computer. I recommend python 3. Also use Windows. The commands are slightly different on Linux. ###
### 2) I used Git's command-line but you can use any so long as you can get python running on it. ###
### 3) Once python is installed, you can install the "requests" library on your command-line by typing: $ python -m pip install requests ###
### 4) For the source code, type the following commands: ###
###     $ git clone git://github.com/psf/requests.git    ###
###     $ cd requests                                    ###
###     $ python -m pip install .                        ###
### 5) Once that's done, you can type: $ python ###
### 6) Now you are on python and you are ready to execute the code! ###

Briefly describe how your code works and how to test it. This includes the required platform, compiler, libraries, build instructions, etc.
